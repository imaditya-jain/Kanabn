Relationships Overview
SuperAdmin manages Companies.
Companies own Users and their data.
Users can create, assign, and manage Tasks.
Teams are groups of Users and are linked to Projects.
Users log attendance and apply for leaves.
Leave approval is routed to Manager.


To implement your **Employee Management Dashboard**, the development flow should follow the logical sequence of dependencies between entities. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you set up the application:

---

### **Step 1: SuperAdmin Setup**
1. **Create the SuperAdmin Role**:
   - Start by defining the `SuperAdmin` model.
   - Create a default `SuperAdmin` account during initial deployment (seed the database with credentials).
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const superAdmin = new SuperAdmin({
       name: "Default SuperAdmin",
       email: "admin@dashboard.com",
       password: hashPassword("password"), // Ensure password is hashed
     });
     await superAdmin.save();
     ```

2. **SuperAdmin Login**:
   - Implement a login endpoint for the `SuperAdmin` to authenticate.
   - Once authenticated, allow access to create and manage companies.

---

### **Step 2: Create Company**
1. **Define the `Company` Model**:
   - Set up the company structure in the database.
   - Link it with the `SuperAdmin` through the `created_by` field.

2. **Company Creation by SuperAdmin**:
   - Build an endpoint for `SuperAdmin` to create companies.
   - Required details:
     - Company Name
     - Address
   - Example Request:
     ```json
     POST /api/companies
     {
       "name": "TechCorp",
       "address": "123 Business Lane"
     }
     ```

3. **Return the `company_id`**:
   - After creating a company, return its `id` to associate with future actions (like adding users).

---

### **Step 3: Add Users (Employees & Managers)**
1. **Define the `User` Model**:
   - Include fields for `role`, `manager_id` (for employees), and `company_id`.

2. **User Creation**:
   - SuperAdmin creates users (employees and managers) associated with a specific company.
   - Example Process:
     - Manager Creation:
       ```json
       POST /api/users
       {
         "name": "John Doe",
         "email": "john@techcorp.com",
         "role": "manager",
         "company_id": "company_id_from_previous_step"
       }
       ```
     - Employee Creation:
       ```json
       POST /api/users
       {
         "name": "Jane Smith",
         "email": "jane@techcorp.com",
         "role": "employee",
         "manager_id": "manager_id_here",
         "company_id": "company_id_from_previous_step"
       }
       ```

3. **User Login and Authentication**:
   - Implement authentication for users (employee/manager) using JWT or session-based tokens.

---

### **Step 4: Tasks Management**
1. **Define the `Task` Model**:
   - Tasks should have `assigned_to`, `created_by`, and `company_id`.

2. **Task Assignment**:
   - Implement endpoints for task creation:
     - Admin, Manager, or Employee can create a task.
     - Admin and Managers can assign tasks to users in the same company.

3. **Example Task Creation**:
   ```json
   POST /api/tasks
   {
     "title": "Complete Report",
     "description": "Submit by EOD",
     "assigned_to": "employee_id",
     "created_by": "manager_id",
     "company_id": "company_id"
   }
   ```

---

### **Step 5: Team Management**
1. **Define `Team` and `TeamMember` Models**:
   - Create teams linked to companies.
   - Assign users (employees and managers) to teams.

2. **Create Teams**:
   - Only Admin or Managers can create teams.

3. **Assign Users to Teams**:
   - Add `User` IDs to teams through the `TeamMember` table.

4. **Example**:
   ```json
   POST /api/teams
   {
     "name": "Development Team",
     "created_by": "manager_id",
     "company_id": "company_id"
   }
   ```

---

### **Step 6: Projects Management**
1. **Define the `Project` Model**:
   - Link projects to teams and companies.

2. **Project Creation**:
   - Only Admin or Managers can create projects.

3. **Example**:
   ```json
   POST /api/projects
   {
     "name": "New Website Launch",
     "description": "Develop the company website",
     "team_id": "team_id",
     "created_by": "admin_id",
     "company_id": "company_id"
   }
   ```

---

### **Step 7: Attendance Tracking**
1. **Define the `Attendance` Model**:
   - Include `check_in`, `check_out`, and `status`.

2. **Employee and Manager Attendance**:
   - Allow employees and managers to mark attendance.
   - Example:
     ```json
     POST /api/attendance
     {
       "user_id": "employee_id",
       "status": "present",
       "check_in": "2024-12-06T09:00:00"
     }
     ```

---

### **Step 8: Leave Management**
1. **Define the `Leave` Model**:
   - Include `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`, and `manager_id`.

2. **Leave Request by Employee/Manager**:
   - Employees and managers can request leaves.
   - Example:
     ```json
     POST /api/leaves
     {
       "user_id": "employee_id",
       "start_date": "2024-12-10",
       "end_date": "2024-12-12",
       "reason": "Personal Leave"
     }
     ```

3. **Leave Approval**:
   - Allow managers to approve/reject leaves:
     ```json
     PATCH /api/leaves/{leave_id}
     {
       "status": "approved"
     }
     ```

---

### **Step 9: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
1. **Set Up Middleware**:
   - Use middleware to validate user roles and permissions.

2. **Example Access Control**:
   - Admin can access all routes.
   - Managers can access routes for their teams.
   - Employees have limited access.

---

### Suggested Implementation Stack:
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express or NestJS
- **Database**: MongoDB (with Mongoose) or SQL-based DB (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **Frontend**: React.js/Next.js for dashboard UI

---

### Flow Summary:
1. Set up `SuperAdmin`.
2. Create `Companies` via `SuperAdmin`.
3. Add `Users` (Employees & Managers) to companies.
4. Allow task creation and assignment.
5. Implement team and project management.
6. Add attendance and leave management features.
7. Apply RBAC for access control.
